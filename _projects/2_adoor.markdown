In the article "A Software Engineer's Advice for Saving Social Media? Keep It Small" by Meg Miller, the author quotes Darius Kazemi, a renowned Internet artist who refers to ​Facebook as the "digital equivalent of a town square," and advocates for sites that are more like `"a chill house party with a considered guest list"​`. The key, he emphasizes, is keeping the social network small so that it can serve specifically for the needs of the community - in ways that social networks with millions of users never could.

Our preference for social media platform has changed over the years. *Cyworld*, a private social media for close relationships serviced in Korea, used to be the most dominant social media platform for several years, but it has been completely replaced with newer social media platforms. Ever since the current model of “town square” social media gained popularity, people have constantly been reminiscing their very own cyber world. Many turned to Blogs, Finstagram accounts and various other alternatives for their very own ‘chill house parties’. ​The needs of the the users who prefer Cyworld over Facebook or Instagram are facing are not gone, but unmet.

To address such problem and suggest a complementary social media ideal for building close relationships online through personalized conversation starters. The design and implementation of our service is as detailed below.
