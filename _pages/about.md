Hi! :) I am a rising 3rd year PhD candidate student at the University of Washington Information School, advised by Prof. [Alexis Hiniker](https://www.alexishiniker.com/) at the [User Empowerment Lab](https://www.userempowerment.org/).

Broadly speaking, my research is in the field of human-computer interaction and social computing. I focus on 1) understanding, 2) designing, and 3) building social technologies---from broadcast social media to extended reality systems---that center on positive relationship building, especially for the youth.

In my free time, I chat with my two chihuahuas' photos (living back home ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/%EA%B0%90%EA%B7%A4%EA%B0%9C%EA%B5%AC%EB%A6%ACtangerinefrogs" target="_blank">sing</a>.
