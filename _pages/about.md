Hi! :) I am a 3rd year PhD candidate at the University of Washington Information School, advised by Prof. [Alexis Hiniker](https://www.alexishiniker.com/) at the [User Empowerment Lab](https://www.userempowerment.org/).

My research lies broadly in human-computer interaction (HCI) and social computing. I combine empirical work with design and system-building approaches to understand and envision social technologies for `fostering meaningful social connections online`, especially for youth ðŸ‘¯.

I am especially passionate about <a href="https://positech-cscw-2024.github.io/" target="_blank">Positech</a> research (centering human flourishing in social technology design) and am open to collaborations aligning with this vision. Keywords that spark my interest include social AR/VR, mental health and well-being, online communities, and conversational agents.

Outside of research, you can find me <a href="https://jaewonkim.me/fun/" target="_blank">singing</a>, daydreaming, and slowly running, biking, and swimming with hopes of a triathlon someday (emphasis on "slowly").
