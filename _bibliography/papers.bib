  abstract={Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern characterized by doubts in one’s capabilities or achievements despite evident success. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of a smartphone-aided solution for impostor syndrome detection among high-achieving college students by presenting some initial findings from our 3- week user study. We collected GPS, Bluetooth, light, screen and app usage data along with Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) survey results from 37 students. We conducted a correlation analysis between CIPS scores and features extracted from sensor data. Then we grouped the features into three categories that reflect the behavioral characteristics of individuals with impostor syndrome, namely social avoidance, sense of obligation, and restlessness. Based on these findings, we suggest further examination of the use of behavioral sensing data in detecting impostor syndrome.},

  title={Dopameter: Predicting Subtle Malingering of Adult ADHD Symptoms},
  author={JaeWon Kim and Yuna Jeong and Yuri Kim and Eunyoung Kim and Youngki Lee},
  abstract={Extant approaches to assess adult ADHD are easily subject to malingering of symptoms, and solutions to detect subtle malingering (\textit{i.e.,} subconsciously reporting exaggerated symptoms) are especially rare. In this paper, we propose the use of a scalable sensor-enabled framework designed for predicting subtle malingering of adult ADHD symptoms. In our 3-week-long user study, we gather 8 types of mobile sensing data such as GPS and Bluetooth from 37 participants,. We perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the sensing features that we extracted and build our model using the 6 principal components that we obtained. We were able to predict the 14 subtle malingerers that we identified at an AUC of 0.98 and F-score of 0.89. Then, we try to understand our model by assessing the psychological implications of the sensing features through regression and correlation analysis. We open-source our code for sensing application and data analysis and anonymized data.},
